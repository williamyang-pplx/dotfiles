# Vendored skill

`SKILL.md` and `references/` are copied unmodified from
[AminBlg/SimpleEnglish](https://github.com/AminBlg/SimpleEnglish), path
`skills/simple-english/`, at commit `8e8a008a13e4b478f9ccc20ca16e79aef66c0739`
(2026-08-21), skill version 1.3.0.

To update, re-copy the upstream files rather than editing them here, so the
diff against upstream stays empty:

```
repo=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AminBlg/SimpleEnglish/HEAD/skills/simple-english
curl -sS -o SKILL.md "$repo/SKILL.md"
for f in checklist use-cases word-swaps; do
  curl -sS -o "references/$f.md" "$repo/references/$f.md"
done
```
